Hey, I‚Äôm Nikita üëã


I am a Data Science student @ Maastricht University, with a strong interest in machine learning, data-driven systems, and quantitative finance.‚Ä®My academic focus is on developing solid foundations in mathematics, statistics, and computer science to apply them to real-world analytical problems.
I enjoy exploring topics such as algorithmic trading, AI model optimization, and efficient system design. Outside of academics, I regularly participate in hackathons and technical projects that combine analytical thinking with practical implementation.
In my free time, I enjoy tennis, running, and exploring technology that connects theory with impact.
